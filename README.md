# WestBardKiwi Welcomes You!
# About
Hey! My name is WestBardKiwi. I am currently trying my best to do
everything I can to enter into the field of cybersecurity. So far
it has been a rollercoaster. If you are an employer who I applied
to, there is not much here as of the current revision of this doc
as I am still figuring out GitHub. There will be more in the next
few weeks as I practice Version Access Controls. Stay tuned!

If you happened across this page just browsing GitHub, please try
to stick around long enough to browse the repositories if any are
available to view. I have only used git/GitHub long enough to see
that I know nothing and have to learn everything. At some point I
will star more repos that way those browsing can see what kind of
projects peak my interest or projects that I currently am working
with. Have a wonderful day!

# Contact
Publishing contact information on a public website does not align
with good PERSEC practices. If you are an employer, I've listed a
couple best ways to contact (EMAIL being preferred).
